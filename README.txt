DESCRIPTION
--------------------
Active Anomaly Detection (AAD) with process mining enables end-users to both gain insight in the process of the client and adjust the weights of individual models in the ensemble method at the same time. In main.py, the AAD framework is instantiated with an Isolation Forest.


INSTALL
--------------------
All dependencies can be found in requirements.txt and are automatically installed when opening the Dockerfile.


SETUP
--------------------
Run main.py to preprocess and enrich event log, calculate anomaly score, and run feedback loop.
